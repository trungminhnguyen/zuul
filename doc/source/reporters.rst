:title: Reporters

Reporters
=========

Zuul can communicate results and progress back to configurable
protocols. For example, after succeeding in a build a pipeline can be
configured to post a positive review back to Gerrit.

There are three stages when a report can be handled. That is on:
Start, Success or Failure. Each stage can have multiple reports.
For example, you can set verified on Gerrit and send an email.

Gerrit
------

Zuul works with standard versions of Gerrit by invoking the
``gerrit`` command over an SSH connection.  It reports back to
Gerrit using SSH.

The dictionary passed to the Gerrit reporter is used for ``gerrit
review`` arguments, with the boolean value of ``true`` simply
indicating that the argument should be present without following it
with a value. For example, ``verified: 1`` becomes ``gerrit review
--verified 1`` and ``submit: true`` becomes ``gerrit review
--submit``.

A :ref:`connection` that uses the gerrit driver must be supplied to the
trigger.

GitHub
------

Zuul reports back to GitHub pull requests via GitHub API.
On success and failure, it creates a comment containing the build results.
It also sets the status on start, success and failure. Status name and
description is taken from the pipeline.

A :ref:`connection` that uses the github driver must be supplied to the
reporter. It has the following options.

  **status**
  Boolean value (``true`` or ``false``) that determines if the reporter should
  set commit status on github. Defaults to ``false``.
  ``commit_status=true``

  **comment**
  Boolean value (``true`` or ``false``) that determines if the reporter should
  add a comment with the pipeline status to the github pull request.
  Defaults to ``false``.
  ``comment=true``

  **merge**
  Boolean value (``true`` or ``false``) that determines if the reporter should
  merge the pull reqeust. Defaults to ``false``.
  ``merge=false``

  **label**
  List of strings each representing an exact label name which should be added
  to the pull request by reporter. To remove a label by reporter prepend a dash
  to the label name. Defaults to empty list.
  ``label: 'test successful'``
  ``label: '-test failed'``


SMTP
----

A simple email reporter is also available.

A :ref:`connection` that uses the smtp driver must be supplied to the
trigger.

SMTP Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

zuul.conf contains the SMTP server and default to/from as described
in :ref:`zuulconf`.

Each pipeline can overwrite the ``subject`` or the ``to`` or ``from`` address by
providing alternatives as arguments to the reporter. For example, ::

  pipelines:
    - name: post-merge
      manager: IndependentPipelineManager
      source: my_gerrit
      trigger:
        my_gerrit:
          - event: change-merged
      success:
        outgoing_smtp:
          to: you@example.com
      failure:
        internal_smtp:
          to: you@example.com
          from: alternative@example.com
          subject: Change {change} failed
